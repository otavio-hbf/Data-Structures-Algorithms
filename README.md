# Data-Structures-Algorithms
These are a few of the challenges I had to solve to conclude my DS and Algorithms course!
I learned about Linked-list, stacks, queues, heaps, avl, bsts, hashtables, sorting algorithms,
graphs and graph algorithms (such as dijkstra's, DFS, BFS, Kruskal's, Prim's), Backtracking, Branch and Bound and Dynamic Programming!
